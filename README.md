I learned alot about CSS Flexbox and Responsive Web Design. W3school.com helped me with Viewport & Media Queries.

### Continued development

I plan on growing my knowledge on flexbox by studying more on w3school.com

### Useful resources

- [w3school.com](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This site helped me with HTML & CSS.
- [CSS Flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand CSS Flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
